### Project goal: 
- When a new driver runs for the tests, the driver will run with a different proxy address. **[IN PROGRESS]** 
- Proxy addresses will be retrieved from the live API updated every 10 minutes. **[COMPLATED]✓** 
- In case the API doesn't work or returns less than the requested number of results, the different API will be run. **[COMPLATED]✓**
- The proxy used in each different session will be saved in excel.  **[COMPLATED]✓**
